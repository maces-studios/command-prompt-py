The program stores your language data in a file named "languageSettings.mqs". The program automatically saves and reads the language you set at the first start. (If you enter an invalid language code or text, it will ask again.) Also, the directory of the file (". \ Include \ languageSettings.mqs") will be created automatically when the project is first opened.
